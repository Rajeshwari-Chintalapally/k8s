1.Pod:  Containers are encapsulated into a kubernates object. It is a single instance of appliaction.smallest object created in k8s.
      Single pod can have multiple containers and it should have different containers(not same).
       - additional containers use as helper container which used for if application need additional support for configurations or file processing  etc..
      Two containers communicate using local host and share volume
2.Replica: Prevent loosing access to application, will maintain more than on pod to run application. To achive high availability.
3.Replication contoller: This specifies number of specified pods create/run all time.
                       This also spin pods across nodes.
4.Replicaset: new version of replication contorller to achieve replication
            Monitors the pods health and deploy new pods if required
            Labels and selectors helps replicaSet to monitor pods. Based on labels and selectors Replicaset can identify which pods this need to monitor.
-------------------------------------------
ReplicationController is the older resource used to ensure a specified number of pod replicas are running at any time. 
It only supports equality-based selectors.

ReplicaSet is the newer, more advanced version that replaces ReplicationController. 
It supports both equality- and set-based selectors, allowing more flexible pod selection. ReplicaSet is used by Deployments to manage pods.

Summary:
ReplicaSet is the modern replacement for ReplicationController, offering more features and flexibility. 
ReplicationController is now deprecated in favor of ReplicaSet.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Equality-based selectors in Kubernetes are used to select resources (like pods) based on exact matches of label key-value pairs.            
                       
selector:
  matchLabels:
    app: nginx
This selector matches pods with the label app=nginx.

Supported operators:

= (equals)
== (equals)
!= (not equals)
Note:
Equality-based selectors do not support set-based operations like in, notin, or matching multiple values. Those are only available in set-based selectors.
